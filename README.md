# CPM-Project
This is a personal project created by me.

This uses the Critical Path Method used in supply chain to calculate the earliest possible finish time of a group of tasks, as well as schedule the nodes in order.
Nodes (tasks) can have multiple predecessor and successor nodes. There can be multiple starting and ending nodes as well. This project works with this functionality,
but I am currently working on adding more features.
